## To-Do (as of 21/1/21)
- Find bugs and fix


## Tutorial for i3-wm settings:

 - Background handled by swaybg
 - Gtk3 theme handled by lxappearance
 - Filebrowser = Thunar
 - Default Terminal-Emulator = Alacritty
 - Text-Editor = geany

Main shortcuts:

[mod] key is set to the winkey (or should i call it linkey?)

 - [mod]+enter = open terminal (alacritty)
 - [mod]+w = open Browser (firefox)
 - [mod]+d = app menu (wofi)
 - [mod]+q = close focused app [kill]
 - (Shift) Print-key = screenshot (swaybg)

## Tiling:

Is set to default for swaywm and can be changed to:

- stacking: Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of windows at the top of the container.

- tabbed: so each new window will open fullscreen as a tab, you can change between window-tabs with mouse or shortcut: [mod]+Left focus left (left arrow key) [mod]+Right focus right (right arrow key)
